# Get User Info
A small project to demonstrate getting and displaying user info

### Basic Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Create and checkout a new branch to work on this project
3. Create a new C# console application
4. Using C# classes to implement, ask the user for information about themselves:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Favorite Number
    - Favorite Animal
    - Any other information you want to ask about
5. After getting all their information, display it back to them as sentences, such as "Hello, John Doe.", "Your favorite number is 2.", etc.)
    - If their favorite number is greater than 10, display it in green
    - If their favorite number is less than 5, display it in red
6. Submit a pull request to merge your changes to the `master` branch
Extra: If comfortable with classes, find other things in this application that could be classes, or add any other feature you might want
